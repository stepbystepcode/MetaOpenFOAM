// ************************************************************************* //

Wait, but in the example, the mergePatchPairs was not present, but it's optional. Including it with empty is okay.

Now, check if all faces are covered. The hex has 6 faces, each assigned to a boundary. The frontAndBack combines two faces (front and back), so that's okay.

The topWall is correctly assigned to the face at y=1. The other walls are correct.

This should create a cube with all walls except the top, which is a wall. The top wall can then have a velocity boundary condition set to 1 m/s in the x-direction in the U file.

I think this should work. Let me double-check the vertices and faces.

Another thing: the scale is set to 1, so the coordinates are in meters. The user didn't specify dimensions, so assuming unit length is okay.

Yes, this should be the correct blockMeshDict for a lid-driven cavity with the top wall moving at 1 m/s.
