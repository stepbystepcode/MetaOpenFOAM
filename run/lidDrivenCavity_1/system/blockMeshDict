Wait, edges and mergePatchPairs are optional. The original example didn't have edges, so I can omit them.

Now, check if all faces are assigned. The block has 6 faces, and all are covered by the boundaries.

Yes:

- leftWall: x=0 face.

- rightWall: x=1.

- bottomWall: y=0.

- topWall: y=1.

- frontSymmetry: z=0.

- backSymmetry: z=0.001.

That's all six faces.

Now, the topWall is the moving wall. In OpenFOAM, the velocity boundary condition for walls is typically zeroGradient (no-slip), but for a moving wall, we set the velocity to the wall's velocity. So in the 0/U file, the topWall will have a fixedValue boundary condition with value (1 0 0). But that's beyond the blockMeshDict, which is just the geometry.

The user's requirement is met by having all walls as walls, with the topWall being a wall (so that the velocity can be set there).

Therefore, this blockMeshDict should work.

Wait, but in the original example, the z-coordinate was 0.001. I kept that, but maybe it's better to use 1 for z as well? No, because the problem is 2D, so the z-dimension is just a dummy. Using 0.001 is okay.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the z to be 1 as well, but that would make it 3D. Probably better to keep it thin in z.

So the final blockMeshDict should look like this.
