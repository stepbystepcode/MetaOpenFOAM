FoamFile header, dimensions, internalField, then boundaryField with all four walls. 

Wait, the user's example uses #includeEtc "caseDicts/setConstraintTypes". I should include that as well. 

So putting it all together:

The FoamFile section remains the same. The dimensions and internalField are as in the example. The boundaryField includes all four walls. Let me list them:

boundaryField
{
    #includeEtc "caseDicts/setConstraintTypes"

    topWall
    {
        type            fixedFluxExtrapolatedPressure;
    }

    bottomWall
    {
        type            fixedFluxExtrapolatedPressure;
    }

    leftWall
    {
        type            fixedFluxExtrapolatedPressure;
    }

    rightWall
    {
        type            fixedFluxExtrapolatedPressure;
    }
}

Wait, but in the example, the left and bottom were present. The user's problem has a cavity, so the right and top are also walls. So adding those. 

Alternatively, maybe the names of the patches are different. The user didn't specify the patch names, but assuming the standard names like topWall, bottomWall, leftWall, rightWall. 

Therefore, the final p file would have all four walls with fixedFluxExtrapolatedPressure. 

I think that's it. Let me check again. The key points are the pressure dimensions, uniform 0 internal field, and all walls as fixedFluxExtrapolatedPressure. The moving wall's velocity is handled in the U file, not here. So this should be correct.
