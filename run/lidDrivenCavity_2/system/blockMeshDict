FoamFile header, then scale 1, vertices as listed, blocks, and boundaries as above.

Wait, let me write it step by step.

The FoamFile section is standard:

FoamFile
{
    version     2.0;
    format      ascii;
    class       dictionary;
    object      blockMeshDict;
}

Then scale 1;

vertices as the eight points.

blocks with the hex and divisions.

boundary with the five patches: bottomWall, topWall, leftWall, rightWall, frontAndBack.

Wait, in the original example, the boundary list had six entries, but here we have five. Let me count again:

Yes, five patches: bottomWall, topWall, leftWall, rightWall, frontAndBack. That's five, which is correct.

Now, check the order of the vertices in each face. For example, the topWall's face is (2 3 7 6). Let's see:

Vertex 2 is (0,1,0), 3 is (1,1,0), 7 is (1,1,0.001), 6 is (0,1,0.001). So the face is ordered correctly as a quadrilateral.

Similarly, the frontAndBack's first face (0 1 3 2) is the z=0 face, which is the bottom in z, but in the block's lower layer. The order is correct.

Now, the topWall is a wall, and in the 0/U file, the boundary condition for topWall would be fixedValue with uniform (1 0 0). The other walls are zeroGradient or fixedValue zero. But that's beyond the blockMeshDict, but the mesh is set up correctly.

I think that's all. Let me write the code accordingly.
