FoamFile block is standard, so I can copy that as is. The location is "system" and object "fvSchemes", which is correct.

The ddtSchemes section has default as steadyState. Since lid-driven cavity is typically a steady-state problem, that's okay. Unless the user wants transient, but the problem statement doesn't mention that, so keep it as steadyState.

GradSchemes: The default is Gauss linear. The example has a 'limited' entry, but maybe that's for specific variables. Since the problem is simpler, maybe just keeping the default is sufficient. Wait, in the example, the 'limited' line might be for turbulence variables, but since the cavity might be laminar? Hmm, the user didn't specify turbulence, so maybe the turbulence entries in divSchemes can be omitted. Wait, but the example includes turbulence terms. Let me think. The lid-driven cavity is often solved with laminar flow unless high Reynolds number. Since the problem doesn't mention turbulence, perhaps the turbulence schemes can be removed. But the user's example includes them, so maybe they expect similar structure. Alternatively, maybe the example is for a turbulent case, but the user's problem is incompressible, so maybe it's okay to keep the same schemes but adjust if needed.

Moving to divSchemes. The key equation here is the momentum equation, which is div(phi,U). The example uses bounded Gauss linearUpwindV limited. The linearUpwind is a upwind-biased scheme which is good for convection terms. Since the cavity has advection, this is appropriate. The 'V' in linearUpwindV might be a typo or specific to the example's setup. Alternatively, maybe it's a variant. The standard is linearUpwind. Maybe I should use linearUpwind instead of linearUpwindV unless there's a specific reason. Wait, in OpenFOAM, linearUpwind is a standard scheme. The example might have a typo, but perhaps the user's provided file is correct. Alternatively, maybe linearUpwindV is a custom scheme. Since I'm not sure, perhaps it's safer to use the standard linearUpwind. Alternatively, just follow the example's structure but check if the variables are relevant.

The turbulence entries (div(phi,k), etc.) are for turbulence models. Since the problem might be laminar, those lines can be omitted. But if the user's example includes them, maybe they expect to keep them, but perhaps the problem is laminar. Wait, the problem says incompressible lid-driven cavity. The standard cavity problem is often laminar unless Reynolds is high. Since the speed is 1 m/s, but without knowing the fluid properties, maybe it's safer to assume laminar. Therefore, the turbulence schemes can be removed. But the example includes them, so maybe the user expects similar structure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a turbulence model. Hmm, the user didn't specify, so maybe better to keep the same as the example but note that if it's laminar, those lines might not be needed. Alternatively, since the problem is incompressible and lid-driven, perhaps the turbulence terms are not required. Let me think again. The simpleFoam solver can handle both laminar and turbulent flows depending on the turbulence model included. Since the user didn't mention turbulence, maybe it's laminar. Therefore, the turbulence schemes in divSchemes can be removed. But the example includes them, so perhaps the user expects to have them. Alternatively, maybe the example is for a turbulent case, so the user's problem might also need them. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Since the problem is a lid-driven cavity, which is often laminar unless high Re, but without knowing Re, perhaps it's better to include the turbulence schemes but comment them out? Or maybe the user just wants the basic setup. Alternatively, proceed with the example's structure but remove the turbulence lines if they are not needed. Alternatively, keep them as in the example but adjust if necessary. Let me proceed by keeping the same structure as the example, but maybe the user's problem is laminar, so perhaps the turbulence terms can be omitted. Alternatively, perhaps the example's divSchemes includes those for a turbulent case, so if the user's problem is laminar, those lines can be removed. Let me check the example's divSchemes again. The example has:

div(phi,U) bounded Gauss linearUpwindV limited;

Then turbulence: bounded Gauss linearUpwind limited;

Then div(phi,k) $turbulence etc. So if the problem is laminar, those lines (turbulence, k, epsilon, R) can be removed. The other lines like div(dev(R)) etc. are probably for turbulence models. So in a laminar case, those can be omitted. Therefore, in the user's case, since it's a lid-driven cavity (probably laminar), the divSchemes would have:

div(phi,U) bounded Gauss linearUpwind limited; (without the V, maybe?)

Wait, the example uses linearUpwindV, but maybe that's a typo. Let me confirm. In OpenFOAM, the standard upwind scheme for divergence is linearUpwind. The 'V' might be a mistake. So perhaps the correct scheme is linearUpwind. So I'll adjust that.

So the divSchemes section would be:

divSchemes
{
    default             none;

    div(phi,U)          bounded Gauss linearUpwind limited;

    // The rest (turbulence terms) are omitted since it's laminar
}

Wait, but the example has 'bounded Gauss linearUpwindV limited' for div(phi,U). The 'bounded' keyword ensures that the scheme is bounded, which is good for stability. The 'limited' after might be part of the syntax? Wait, the syntax for bounded schemes in OpenFOAM is like bounded Gauss linearUpwind <limiter>. So the limiter here is 'limited'? Wait, no, the limiter is a specific function like vanLeer or something. Wait, perhaps in the example, the 'limited' is a typo. Let me think. The standard syntax for a bounded scheme is:

div(phi,U) bounded Gauss linearUpwind <limiter>;

Where <limiter> is like van Leer, etc. But in the example, it's written as 'bounded Gauss linearUpwindV limited'. Maybe the 'V' is part of the scheme name, like linearUpwindV is a variant, and 'limited' is the limiter. Alternatively, perhaps the example has a typo. Alternatively, maybe the user's example is using a different limiter. Alternatively, perhaps the 'limited' is a separate entry. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me check OpenFOAM documentation. 

Looking up OpenFOAM's fvSchemes, the div scheme for phi,U is typically something like:

div(phi,U) Gauss linearUpwind grad(U);

But with bounded, it would be:

div(phi,U) bounded Gauss linearUpwind <limiter>;

The limiter is a function like van Leer, but in the example, it's written as 'limited'. Maybe that's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the example uses a different limiter. Alternatively, maybe the 'limited' is part of the scheme name. Alternatively, perhaps the example is using a custom scheme. Since I'm not sure, perhaps it's better to use the standard approach. Let me think. The user's example has:

div(phi,U) bounded Gauss linearUpwindV limited;

Perhaps the 'V' is a typo and should be 'linearUpwind', and 'limited' is the limiter. But 'limited' isn't a standard limiter. The standard limiters are van Leer, van Albada, etc. So maybe the example has a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the 'limited' is a typo for 'vanLeer' or another limiter. Since I can't be sure, perhaps I should follow the example's syntax but adjust if possible. Alternatively, use the standard approach. Let me proceed with the example's syntax but note that maybe the 'V' is a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user's example is correct, so I'll keep it as is. Wait, but the user wants the code to meet their requirement, so perhaps the key is to use a stable scheme for the lid-driven cavity. The linearUpwind is a good choice for convection terms. The bounded keyword ensures boundedness. The limiter is needed. Since the example uses 'limited', perhaps that's a placeholder, but in OpenFOAM, the limiter must be specified. For example, 'vanLeer' or 'minmod'. Alternatively, maybe the example's 'limited' is a typo and should be 'vanLeer'. Hmm, this is a problem. Since I can't be sure, perhaps I should use the standard syntax. Let me think again. The user's example might have a mistake, but I have to follow it as a reference. Let me check the example again. The example's gradSchemes has a line:

limited         cellLimited Gauss linear 1;

Maybe that's a custom entry. But in the div(phi,U) line, the 'limited' might refer to that. Wait, perhaps the 'limited' in the div(phi,U) line refers to the 'limited' entry in gradSchemes. Like using the 'limited' gradient scheme. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the example is using a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the user's example is using a different limiter. Since I'm not sure, perhaps I should proceed with the example's syntax but adjust the turbulence terms. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user's example is using a turbulence model, so the divSchemes includes those terms. Since the problem is a lid-driven cavity, which is often laminar, maybe those terms are not needed. So in the user's case, the divSchemes would have only the div(phi,U) line and the default. Let me structure it as:

divSchemes
{
    default             none;

    div(phi,U)          bounded Gauss linearUpwind limited; // assuming the example's syntax is correct
}

Wait, but the example uses linearUpwindV. Maybe that's a typo and should be linearUpwind. So I'll change that. Also, the 'limited' might be a limiter, but perhaps it's better to use a standard limiter like vanLeer. Alternatively, maybe the example's 'limited' is a typo and should be 'vanLeer'. Since I can't be sure, perhaps I'll follow the example's syntax but remove the turbulence terms. 

So the divSchemes section would be:

divSchemes
{
    default             none;

    div(phi,U)          bounded Gauss linearUpwind limited;

    // The rest (turbulence terms) are omitted since it's laminar
}

Wait, but the example's turbulence line is 'bounded Gauss linearUpwind limited;', so maybe that's the limiter. Alternatively, perhaps the 'limited' is a separate entry. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the example's 'limited' is a typo and should be 'vanLeer', but I'll proceed as per the example.

Next, the laplacianSchemes: The example uses Gauss linear orthogonal. That's standard, so keep that.

interpolationSchemes: default linear. That's okay for most cases.

snGradSchemes: default orthogonal. Also standard.

wallDist: method meshWave, nRequired yes. That's okay.

Putting it all together, the fvSchemes file would look like the example but without the turbulence terms in divSchemes. Also, changing linearUpwindV to linearUpwind if needed. Let me check the example's exact line again:

div(phi,U)          bounded Gauss linearUpwindV limited;

So if I keep the 'V', maybe it's part of the scheme name. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo. Since I can't be sure, I'll keep it as in the example. Wait, but in OpenFOAM, the standard is linearUpwind. The 'V' might be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe it's a different scheme. Since I'm not sure, perhaps it's better to use the example's exact syntax. 

Therefore, the final fvSchemes would be similar to the example, but removing the turbulence-related entries in divSchemes. So the divSchemes section would have only the div(phi,U) line and the default. The rest (turbulence, k, epsilon, R, dev(R), etc.) are removed. 

So the code would be:

/* ... header ... */

ddtSchemes
{
    default         steadyState;
}

gradSchemes
{
    default         Gauss linear;
    limited         cellLimited Gauss linear 1;
}

divSchemes
{
    default             none;

    div(phi,U)          bounded Gauss linearUpwindV limited;
}

laplacianSchemes
{
    default         Gauss linear orthogonal;
}

interpolationSchemes
{
    default         linear;
}

snGradSchemes
{
    default         orthogonal;
}

wallDist
{
    method          meshWave;
    nRequired       yes;
}

Wait, but the user's problem is incompressible, so the example's other terms (like turbulence) are not needed. So yes, removing those. 

Alternatively, maybe the user's problem is using a turbulence model, but since it's not specified, better to assume laminar. 

Therefore, the final fvSchemes file would look like that. Let me check again for any other possible changes. The gradSchemes has a 'limited' entry, which might be for turbulence variables, but since we're not using them, maybe it's okay to leave it as is. The interpolation schemes are okay. 

Yes, this should work. So the code is as above.
