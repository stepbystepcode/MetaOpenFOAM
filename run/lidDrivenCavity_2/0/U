FoamFile section with format, class, and object. I should keep those the same except maybe the object is already U, so that's fine. The dimensions are [0 1 -1 0 0 0 0], which is correct for velocity (m/s). 

The internalField is uniform (0 0 1.95). Wait, in the lid-driven cavity, the initial velocity is usually zero everywhere except the lid. So maybe the internalField should be uniform (0 0 0). The example uses 1.95, but that's probably for their specific case. So I'll set internalField to uniform (0 0 0).

Now the boundaryField. The example has bottomWall and leftWall with noSlip. The user's problem has four walls: top, bottom, left, right. The top wall is moving in x-direction at 1 m/s. The others are noSlip.

So I need to define all four walls. Let me think of the boundary names. The example uses bottomWall and leftWall. Maybe the user's case uses similar names like topWall, bottomWall, leftWall, rightWall. I'll assume that. 

For the topWall, since it's moving, the type should be fixedValue. Then the value would be uniform (1 0 0) assuming 2D in x-y plane, so z-component is 0. 

The other walls (bottom, left, right) are noSlip. So their entries would be type noSlip.

Wait, the example includes #includeEtc "caseDicts/setConstraintTypes". I should include that too. 

Putting it all together:

The boundaryField section should have entries for each of the four walls. Let me list them:

boundaryField
{
    #includeEtc "caseDicts/setConstraintTypes"

    topWall
    {
        type            fixedValue;
        value           uniform (1 0 0);
    }

    bottomWall
    {
        type            noSlip;
    }

    leftWall
    {
        type            noSlip;
    }

    rightWall
    {
        type            noSlip;
    }
}

Wait, but in the example, the leftWall is there, but maybe the right wall is also present. The user didn't mention the names, but assuming standard names. So I need to make sure all four are included. 

The internalField is set to zero. 

So the full code would look like the example but with these changes. Let me check again:

- internalField: uniform (0 0 0)
- boundaryField includes topWall with fixedValue and value (1 0 0), and the others as noSlip.

Yes, that should do it. Let me write that out.
